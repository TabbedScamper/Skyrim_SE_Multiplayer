## Why GPL-3.0-or-later

The Skyrim 1.7.x build statically links CommonLibSSE-NG 7.2.0 (https://github.com/alandtse/CommonLibSSE-NG, commit
7a60f4de794095d7b0f8928d1b930a52e9a7da83), GPL-3.0-or-later WITH its Modding Exception and GPL-3.0 Linking Exception,
whose README requires a linking plugin to be GPL-3.0-or-later or GPL-compatible. The whole work - both build lines and
the source - is GPL-3.0-or-later.

Components under other licences, with their notices: `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Origins

Written for this project. The idea is Parapets' Auto Audio Switch (Nexus mod 134404), known here from its public
description only; none of its files were read. The device-switch procedure - rebuilding the game's own audio engine on
its audio thread and reviving each live sound - is built on Live Audio Output Switching SE by Mern (Maarten Harms) - MIT,
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/184853, notice in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` - ported to three game
versions.
